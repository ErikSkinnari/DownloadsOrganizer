# DownloadsOrganizer

My downloads folder is always a mess. So finally I made this little thing that sorts all my downloaded files into specified folders depending on the filetype. ðŸ“‚

The source folder and names of the target folders is set with settings from a configuration file. ðŸ“‹
If no source folder is set, the Downloads-folder is set to the source folder.
