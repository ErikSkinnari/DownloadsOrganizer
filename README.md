# DownloadsOrganizer

My downloads folder is always a mess. So finally I made this little thing that sorts all my downloaded files into specified folders depending on the filetype. ðŸ“‚

For the moment all the settings is hard coded in to the application to my personal preferences(at this point of time). But I will change the code later to read those settings from a configuration file. ðŸ“‹
